   BASIC INSTRUCTIONS FOR RUNNING TEST PROGRAMS

1) You are supposed to have already compiled PYTHIA 8, as described in 
   the README file of the mother directory. For the moment we assume
   that you will NOT use the HepMC, LHAPDF or PYTHIA 6.4 libraries.

2) You are now ready to test run the first twentyseven of the mainNN 
   examples listed below. Type "gmake mainNN" to build an executable 
   "mainNN.exe". Type "./mainNN.exe > output" to run this executable. 
   Then study the output file. The existing files outNN are examples of 
   possible outputs from several runs, so that you can compare.

3) If you want to run your own programs from this directory you can edit
   the "Makefile", adding the name of your main program to the already
   existing ones. Note that different cases exist, depending on which 
   external libraries are to be linked.

4) Type "gmake clean" to clean up the examples directory (but not the
   output files).

----------------------------------------------------------------------

   ADVANCED INSTRUCTIONS FOR RUNNING TEST PROGRAMS

1) If you want to be able to run examples linked to HepMC you should 
   already have set that up with the "./configure" command in the mother 
   directory. If not, you can go back and do it now. This will create 
   files "config.csh" and "config.sh" in the current directory.

2) If you are going to run examples linked with LHAPDF and/or PYTHIA 6.4,
   you should as a first step run the script "configure" in the current 
   directory. You can use command-line arguments to set up the desired 
   library links. 

   The possible options are:
     --help : prints a brief summary of the options described here.
     --enable-debug : turns on debugging flags and turns off optimization
     --enable-shared : use shared library (not yet implemented) (default no)
     --with-lhapdf=lhapdfpath : the path to your local copy of the LHAPDF
         library (must be version 5.3 or higher)
     --with-lhapdfversion=v : a simpler alternative to the above, valid 
         if you are using the CERN AFS MCGenerators area; then you do not 
         need to specify the full path but only the version, e.g. =5.3.0 
         (must be version 5.3 or higher) 
     --with-lhapdflibname=n : lhapdf library name line (default is -lLHAPDF)
     --with-lhapdfsets=path : path to the LHAPDF data files 
         (default is lhapdfpath/../PDFsets, CERN AFS default is 
         lhapdfpath/../../../share/PDFsets)
     --with-pythia6=path : the path to your local copy of the PYTHIA 6.4
         library
     --with-pythia6version=v : a simpler alternative to the above, valid 
         if you are using the CERN AFS MCGenerators area; then you do not 
         need to specify the full path but only the version, e.g. =413 
     --with-pythia6libname=n  : pythia6 library name line: default is the 
         GENSER standard: -lpythia6 -lpythia6_dummy -lpythia6_pdfdummy

   When "configure" is run it will create or append to the config.csh 
   and config.sh files.

3) Before running the examples using external libraries for the first 
   time, type "source config.csh" if you use the csh or tcsh shell, or 
   "source config.sh" otherwise. (Use "echo $SHELL" if uncertain.)
   This will set or append the environment variables LD_LIBRARY_PATH,
   needed to find the HepMC libraries. (Eventually also LHAPDF
   and PYTHIA 6.4 libraries, if shared ones are used. Default, if taken
   from CERN AFS MCGenerators, is archive.) It will also set the variable 
   LHAPATH, needed to find the LHAPDF data files.

4) If you want to change to other LHAPDF or PYTHIA 6 versions, you have
   to rerun the script "configure" and again "source" one of the config.*
   files. In case of using shared libraries (these will  be taken if both 
   shared and archive ones are on the same path) pay attention to the 
   variable LD_LIBRARY_PATH: subsequent commands "source" will add new 
   items to it, not substitute the old ones. As a result, the wrong 
   version can still be loaded at runtime, which can cause relocation 
   errors. A simple solution is to repeat the "configure" and "source" 
   steps in a new window, i.e. in a new clean copy of the shell.

2) main21 - main26 are examples how some external programs could be linked

3) main31 - main32 require linkage to the HepMC event record library
* main31.cc & main31.cmnd : simple example output to HepMC 
* main32.cc & main32.cmnd : streamlined production of a HepMC event file

4) main41 - main42 require linkage to LHAPDF

5) main51 - main54 require linkage to PYTHIA 6.4 (+HepMC once)

* main54.cc & main54.cmnd : input from PYTHIA 6.4 and output to HepMC

Note 1: main31, main32 and main54 save HepMC-formatted events on 
hepmcoutNN.dat; these files become so big that they have not been included 
in the distribution. 
Note 2: There is no main00 program, but main00 is defined in the Makefile
to link to PYTHIA 8, so this name can be used for simple first tests.
