<h2>SUSY Processes</h2>

The implementation of SUSY processes is barely begun, so this page
is more a placeholder than a repository of useful processes.

<p/>
Here is collected processes involving supersymmetric particle 
production, with the exception of the (extended) Higgs sector.
Since the number of separate but closely related processes is so big,
there will not be switches for each separate process but only for a
reasonable set of subgroups.

<br/><br/><b>Important note:</b> 
In order to simulate SUSY processes it is required to read in the 
couplings and masses relevant for the scenario to be studied. This 
is done with the help of the SUSY Les Houches Accord (SLHA). The 
reading of a relevant SLHA file <b>must</b> be set up, as described 
on <a href="SUSYLesHouchesAccord.html" target="page">this page</a>.

<p/><code>flag&nbsp; </code><strong> SUSY:all &nbsp;</strong> 
 (<code>default = <strong>off</strong></code>)<br/>
Common switch for production of supersymmetric particles, i.e. 
particles with R-parity -1. 
  

<p/><code>flag&nbsp; </code><strong> SUSY:qqbar2chi0chi0 &nbsp;</strong> 
 (<code>default = <strong>off</strong></code>)<br/>
Pair production of neutralinos by quark-antiquark annihilation. With
four neutralino species this gives ten separate processes, codes 
1201 - 1210. Neutralino decays have not yet been implemented.
