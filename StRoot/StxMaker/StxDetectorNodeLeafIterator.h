/*! \class StxDetectorNodeLeafIterator
  StxDetectorNodeLeafIterator  is a templated iterator class that is
  complimenatary to StxDetectorNode.  Given a pointer to a
  StxDetectorNode in its  constructor, StxDetectorNodeLeafIterator provides
  access to all of the leaves of that node.  Leaves are defined as nodes that
  have no daughters, and are actaully found using the templated helper class
  LeafFinder.
  StxDetectorNodeLeafIterator stores pointers to the leaves in an internal
  container and provides limited access to the leaves.  Ultimately,
  StxDetectorNodeLeafIterator should conform to the requirements of (at least)
  an STL forward iterator, <b>however it does not yet</b>.  As such, it
  will currently work when passed to some, but not all, STL algorithms.
  However, let it be noted that it provides access to
  const_iterators into the vector of leaves.  These are true STL iterators
  and can be passed to any algorithm that takes const_iterators.
  <p>
  Note that StxDetectorNodeLeafIterator is a "meta" iterator.  That is, it
  is a combination of an iterator and a container.  As such, it must
  provide functionality for both.  This is reflected in its providal of
  operators, e.g., operator++(), and memberfunctions that denote the
  container characteristics, specifically begin() and end().  These names
  have been changed to const_begin() and const_end() to reflect
  that they return const_iterators.
